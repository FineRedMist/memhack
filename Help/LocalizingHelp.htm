<p>I've added an option to MemHack called /verifystrings which you can use to determine whether the strings and resource file load correctly for a resource different than the default of en-US.  If an Not Impemented exception is thrown indicating the locale you are currently set to then it is having a problem loading the file containing your strings.  Otherwise it will generate a Not Implemented exception if it fails to find a string it needs.
