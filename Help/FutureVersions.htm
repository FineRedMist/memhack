<H1>Future Versions</H1>

<p>There are a couple of other features I would like to implement for MemHack.  Some I've experimented with already and haven't solved yet:
<ul>
	<li>Showing the account each process is running as
	<li>Supporting locking the value for a given address (so if it changes it will be reset back to the value specified)
	<li>Possibly a more general memory viewer so you can look at a region of memory around an address in a target application
	<li>Showing the user the list of memory regions
	<li>Fix a really rare race condition on exit causing an object is being disposed of twice
	<li>Fix an unusual performance issue for large numbers of addresses where a Find Next is dramatically less performant than a Find First.
</ul>
