<p>The process list is the means to select the application you want to modify.  The process ID of the application, the application name, and then if it is available a window or service name for the process are displayed to make it easier to identify the application you wish to modify.

<p>The list is sortable based on ID, application name, and window/service name, highlighting the current sorting column in a light grey.

<p>Doubleclicking or pressing the "Select" button for a selected entry will take you to a new window that will allow you to edit the selected process.

<H2>Service or Active Window Names</H2>
<p>Selecting the process will show the full list of (interesting) windows or services that are running under that process.  It will also display the path to the application that is running.  Finally selecting on a window will indicate the date the thread was created and whether it is visible.

<p>This particular aspect of MemHack is useful for identifying which process is running a specific service or owns a specific window.  By knowing the application path you can also identify what application might own a particular process based on where it lives in the Program Files directory for example.  This can be really useful to identify less than desirable applications that are running on your system for the purpose of removing them.
